                    <div class="bio">
                        <p>I’ve been a photographer for about 8 years of my life. I’ve been to destination weddings
                             in Greece, to runways in New York and have done editorials with every type of unique person all at the age of 15.
                              Today I work for a
                             university degree at the university of Lethbridge to branch out into the film industry.</p>

                        <p>For me photography has always been about opportunity, each shot and each second out with a 
                            camera is an opportunity. Nobody ever knows what that opportunity entails, 
                            yet it is what makes the profession so special to me. From the first kiss as a married couple, 
                            to a mom proud to be a first time mother, 
                            every smile, every tear, and expression is an opportunity.</p>

                    <div class="bio">
                        <p>I am not well versed in the world of cameras quite yet but have exelled in my classes
                            due to my creative eye for lighting and motion. Leaning into my passion and drive for 
                            writing sand telling stories also solidifies the passion I have for cinema. Being able to tell my stories through a camera
                            brings life to an imagination that I usually keep hidden.
                        </p>

                        <p>I am currently studying in the media department of the University of Lethbridge which lends itself 
                            well to the creative direction I hope to take possibly as a career. I'm not sure where this will take me
                            but I am excited for my future with a camera ready to document it.

                        <p>A photographer cares about the moment. As a photographer I have to contstanly focus
                            on the details, it is a part of the art form, and that what I love about it. 
                            To bring the beauty of the world around us and capture important moments in our lives is a gift
                            that im glad i get to be a part of.
                            I am pursuing other artistic media at the University of Lethbridge including Cinematography
                            and other forms of art on a screen.
